# Solving-Gradient-Vanishing-and-Exploding-with-MLP
The goal of this project is to solve Gradient problems (Gradient Vanishing and Gradient Exploding) in classic Deep Learning. 3 chosen approaches to solve the problems are: Weight Increasing, Better Activation, Normalization, Skip Connection.
The Dataset used  in this project is FashionMNIST -  Comprising of 28Ã—28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fashion-mnist)
